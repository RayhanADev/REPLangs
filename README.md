Ever wanted to have one of those tiny little widgets on Github (weird that I say that on Github xD) that tell you what percent of your project is composed of what language?

This is a small terminal program made in NodeJS and uses my [ReplAPI.it](https://github.com/RayhanADev/ReplAPI.it) to display your project stats :D!

## TL;DR it's kewl
